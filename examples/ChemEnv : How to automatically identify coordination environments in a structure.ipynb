    "ChemEnv is a fast and robust tool to automatically identify coordination environments (e.g. tetrahedral, octahedral, icosahedral, ...) in a structure. The package is in pymatgen/analysis/chemenv and a script (get_environments.py) is provided in the pymatgen/scripts directory for simple usages. For more advanced usages, you should write your own script(s).\n",

    "Describing materials and compounds in terms of the coordination environments of their constituent atoms is a common and useful practice amongst chemists, crystallographers and materials scientists. The ChemEnv package allows to identify the model coordination environment to which a given (slightly or highly distorted) local environment is the closest. Model coordination environments have been taken from the following two references that were published by the Internation Union of Crystallographers and the Internation Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry respectively :\n",
